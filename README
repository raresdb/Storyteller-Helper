							WHAT'S MAFIA AND WHAT IS THIS PROGRAM?
	Mafia is a party game that involves socialisation, psychology and strategy. A computer variant of the
game has been implemented for browsers, bearing the name Town of Salem. If you don't already know how to
play the game, I suggest you browse on the internet about it.
	This program is a tool for the storyteller player in the live version of mafia. The storyteller won't
have to worry anymore about reasoning the effects of the other players' choices while using this tool.
The program expects input from the user(the storyteller), and prints the conclusions after calculating
the results of every player's choices.

							HOW DOES THE TOOL WORK?
	When the user starts a game, they will be prompted to the setup phase. This phase occurs only once,
being the phase where each player is being given their role. This can be done manually or automatically.
The program asks for the user to input the number of the player that each role has been assigned to.
	After the setup is complete, the game will cycle between the 2 game phases(night and day), after each
phase conclusions are being presented and if the game is over, the game phases cease to cycle. In the night
phase the user will be asked to input the choices of each player. In the day phase the user will input
the eventual player that has been voted by the majority of the other players.

Automatic assignment: The algorithm generates a pseudo-random(using the function clock) number that will be
the index of the player which will be assigned each role. To make sure each role is assigned to a different
player and also assure that the algorithm won't take forever in assigning the numbers - each iteration the
number will be generated between 1 and number of unassigned players and only the unassigned players will be
counted to see where the role will land.
