The storyteller helper is a tool that comes in aid to the storyteller player in
a game of mafia.
For clarifications about the gameplay search for the game on the internet.
This version of the game consists of 5 different characters:
TOWN: police officer, escort and doctor
MAFIA: killer
NEUTRAL: jester
    The town's purpose is to find all members of the mafia and hang them during
the day phase.
    The mafia wins when their number of players is half or more of the number of
living players.
    The neutrals have their own purposes and they usually win separately from the
other players.
    The police officer investigates a player every night in search of the mafia.
If the selected player is a member of the mafia, the storyteller will give the
officer a thumbs-up. Otherwise, the officer will receive a thumbs-down.
    The escort will divert a player each night from doing their task. When a
player has been visited by the escort, they will still be able to choose a
target, but their skill will have no effect in that night. In case of the police
officer, when they choose a target, the storyteller will have to act like they
don't know the answer, for example by giving them a shrug.
    The doctor will heal a player each night. If the visited player has been
injured in that night, then the doctor will cancel the effect of that injury. In
this version of the game the number of heals the doctor can use upon himself has
been reduced to 0.
    The killer inflicts fatal injuries to players each night. If the mortally
injured player isn't visited by the doctor in that night, the next day the
player will die.
    The jester has no special ability, his only purpose is to be hanged during
the day phase. If that happens, the jester wins on his own.
